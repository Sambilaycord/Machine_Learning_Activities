# CS324 - Machine Learning Course Lab Activities
Welcome to the CS324 - Machine Learning Course Lab Activities repository! This repository contains the lab activities for the CS324 Machine Learning course, covering various essential topics and hands-on exercises.

## Lab Activities
### Lab Activity 1: Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning. In this lab, we focus on:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Normalizing and standardizing numerical features

### Lab Activity 2: Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a foundational machine learning algorithm used for predictive modeling. This lab covers:
- Understanding the linear regression equation
- Implementing simple linear regression using Python (NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn)
- Visualizing regression results using Matplotlib
- Evaluating model performance using RMSE and R-squared
